# Network Boundaries
Every host on a network must use the router as a gateway to other networks. 
Therefore, each host must know the IPv4 address of the router interface connected to the network where the host is attached. This address is known as the default gateway address. 
It can be either statically configured on the host or received dynamically by DHCP.
When a wireless router is configured as a DHCP server, it provides its own internal IPv4 address as the default gateway to DHCP clients. 
It also provides them with their respective IPv4 address and subnet mask, as shown in the figure.
The default IPv4 address configured on the local wireless router interface is usually the first host address on that network. 
Internal hosts must be assigned addresses within the same network as the wireless router, either statically configured, or through DHCP. 
The wireless router serves as the boundary between the local internal network and the external internet.
