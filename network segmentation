#IPv4 Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast
##Unicast
IPv4 unicast host addresses are in the address range of 1.1.1.1 to 223.255.255.255. 
However, within this range are many addresses that are reserved for special purposes.
Notice that the subnet mask for 255.255.255.0 is represented using slash notion or /24. 
This indicates that the subnet mask is 24 bits long. The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.

##IPv4 Broadcast
A broadcast packet must be processed by all devices in the same broadcast domain. 
A broadcast domain identifies all hosts on the same network segment. 
A broadcast may be directed or limited. 
A directed broadcast is sent to all hosts on a specific network. 
For example, a host on the 172.16.4.0/24 network sends a packet to 172.16.4.255. 
A limited broadcast is sent to 255.255.255.255. By default, routers do not forward broadcasts.

##IPv4 Multicast
Multicast transmission reduces traffic by allowing a host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to a multicast group.
A multicast packet is a packet with a destination IP address that is a multicast address. 
IPv4 has reserved the 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 addresses as a multicast range.
Hosts that receive particular multicast packets are called multicast clients. 
The multicast clients use services requested by a client program to subscribe to the multicast group.
Each multicast group is represented by a single IPv4 multicast destination address. 
When an IPv4 host subscribes to a multicast group, the host processes packets addressed to this multicast address, and packets addressed to its uniquely allocated unicast address.
Routing protocols such as OSPF use multicast transmissions. 
For example, routers enabled with OSPF communicate with each other using the reserved OSPF multicast address 224.0.0.5. 
Only devices enabled with OSPF will process these packets with 224.0.0.5 as the destination IPv4 address. All other devices will ignore these packets.

#Types of ipv4 addresses
##Public and Private IPv4 Addresses
# RFC 1918 Private Address Ranges

Below is a table outlining the RFC 1918 private IP address ranges, commonly used in private networks to prevent conflicts with public IP addresses.

| Network Address and Prefix | RFC 1918 Private Address Range |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 10.0.0.0/8                 | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255      |
| 172.16.0.0/12              | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255    |
| 192.168.0.0/16             | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255  |

##Private IPv4 Addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT)
These packets have a source IPv4 address that is a private address and a destination IPv4 address that is public (globally routable). 
Packets with a private address must be filtered (discarded) or translated to a public address before forwarding the packet to an ISP.

##Special Use IPv4 Addresses
###Loopback addresses
Loopback addresses (127.0.0.0 /8 or 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254) are more commonly identified as only 127.0.0.1. 
These are special addresses used by a host to direct traffic to itself. 
For example, the ping command is commonly used to test connections to other hosts. 
But you can also use the ping command to test if the IP configuration on your own device, as shown in the figure.

###Pinging the Loopback Interface

###Link-Local addresses
Link-local addresses (169.254.0.0 /16 or 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254) are more commonly known as the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) addresses or self-assigned addresses. 
They are used by a Windows client to self-configure in the event that the client cannot obtain an IP addressing through other methods. 
Link-local addresses can be used in a peer-to-peer connection but are not commonly used for this purpose.

##Legacy Classful Addressing
IPv4 addresses were assigned using classful addressing as defined in RFC 790:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc790
Customers were allocated a network address based on one of three classes, A, B, or C. The RFC divided the unicast ranges into specific classes as follows:

###Class A (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8) - 
Designed to support extremely large networks with more than 16 million host addresses. 
Class A used a fixed /8 prefix with the first octet to indicate the network address and the remaining three octets for host addresses (more than 16 million host addresses per network).
###Class B (128.0.0.0 /16 - 191.255.0.0 /16) - 
Designed to support the needs of moderate to large size networks with up to approximately 65,000 host addresses. 
Class B used a fixed /16 prefix with the two high-order octets to indicate the network address and the remaining two octets for host addresses (more than 65,000 host addresses per network).

###Class C (192.0.0.0 /24 - 223.255.255.0 /24) - 
Designed to support small networks with a maximum of 254 hosts. 
Class C used a fixed /24 prefix with the first three octets to indicate the network and the remaining octet for the host addresses (only 254 host addresses per network).

Note: There is also a Class D multicast block consisting of 224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0 and a Class E experimental address block consisting of 240.0.0.0 - 255.0.0.0.

##Assignment of IP Addresses
###Regional Internet Registries
Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). 
The IANA manages and allocates blocks of IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
RIRs are responsible for allocating IP addresses to ISPs who provide IPv4 address blocks to organizations and smaller ISPs. 
Organizations can also get their addresses directly from an RIR (subject to the policies of that RIR).
>AfriNIC (African Network Information Centre) - Africa Region
>APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) - Asia/Pacific Region
>ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) - North America Region
>LACNIC (Regional Latin-American and Caribbean IP Address Registry) - Latin America and some Caribbean Islands
>RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre) - Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia

#Network Segmentation
##Broadcast Domains and Segmentation
In an Ethernet LAN, devices use broadcasts and the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to locate other devices.
RP sends Layer 2 broadcasts to a known IPv4 address on the local network to discover the associated MAC address. 
Devices on Ethernet LANs also locate other devices using services. 
A host typically acquires its IPv4 address configuration using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which sends broadcasts on the local network to locate a DHCP server.
Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. 
For example, if a switch in the figure were to receive a broadcast, it would forward it to the other switches and other users connected in the network.

##Problems with Large Broadcast Domains
A Large Broadcast Domain - A large broadcast domain is a network that connects many hosts.
Communicating Between Networks - The solution is to reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains in a process called subnetting. 

##Reasons for Segmenting Networks
>reduces overall network traffic and improves network performance. 
>enables an administrator to implement security policies such as which subnets are allowed or not allowed to communicate together. 
>it reduces the number of devices affected by abnormal broadcast traffic due to misconfigurations, hardware/software problems, or malicious intent.

##How network administrators can group subnets
